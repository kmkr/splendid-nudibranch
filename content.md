Latin	Amphiprion ocellaris
Loc		Dumaguete, The Philippines
Tags	anemonefish clownfish 2013 anemone
Desc	Sea anemones are to most fish poisonous. The clownfish however is immune to their stinging tentacles and form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone where the clownfish receive protection from predators, and the anemone benefits from the clownfish' natural activity. For example, the wedging swimming movements from the clownfish stimulate water sirculation around its tentacles, increasing metabolism and growth.

Tags	anemonefish clownfish 2013 anemone
Latin	Amphiprion ocellaris
Desc	Clownfish hatch near the surface and travel deeper to search for a host anemone when they reach their juvenile stage. Within a clownfish population there is a strict hierarchy where juveniles begin at the bottom and have to gradually move upwards by proving their abilities to the rest of the population. In that period they may be victims to agression, and possibly eviction from the anemone by more mature clownfish.

Title	Fuchsia Flatworm
Loc		Dumaguete, The Philippines
Latin	Pseudoceros ferrugineus
Tags	2013 worm
Desc	Flatworms lack circulatory and respiratory organs (such as gills), and respiration is performed by diffusion through the worm's entire surface. They are somewhat similar to nudibranchs in appearance, but the similarity is only superficial. It's easy to distinguish them by the lack of antennas/rhinophores, that they generally move faster and are (duh) flat.

Desc	Perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of nudibranchs is the pair of tentacles on the head, called rhinophores. They are chemical sensors used to smell and taste the chemicals dissolved in the water, such as food and potential mates. Many species of nudibranchs can retracted these vital organs as protection against other fish.

I couldn't find more than one shrimp, but they are very well camouflaged and only one centimeter long so maybe this shrimp didn't live alone after all. You may wonder why the whip is called black coral when it's bright green. The reason is due to its black inner skeleton while the flesh varies in color. P. Unciger shrimps adept by changing their own color to match the coral's color.

Only small parts of the body is exposed, just enought to ambush surprised fish. This worm is quite rare, shy, and mysterious as well. Not much is known about its behaviour. It's theorized that the worm doesn’t see at all but use its excellent receptors to movements in the water to sense nearby fish. The bobbit was one of my reasons to go to Anilao.

Many of these animals feed at night, and the site is turned into a large scale battlefield for the tiny creatures living there. The starfish were many and moving fast, climbing over animals and any obstructing ground they collided into, stopping only to devour the delicious molluscs their tube feet got attached to. Countless squids dancing around in the dark, moving just outside the beam of our lights while concurrently exploiting it for the ongoing hunt. A stargazer landed on the sand and burrowed its tapered body, exposing only its big, heavy, flat head and a vertically slanted mouth. The stargazer waits for passing fish before it jumps upwards while it creates a vacuum to suck in the prey.

Most molluscs use the shell as a primary defence, but nudibranchs have developed other teqniques for protection, such as toxic secretion. A few make their own poisons, but most use the toxic metabolites from what they eat for their own defence.
