Latin			Amphiprion ocellaris
Location		Dumaguete, The Philippines
Tags			anemonefish clownfish 2013 anemone
Description		Sea anemones are to most fish poisonous. The clownfish however is immune to their stinging tentacles and form a symbiotic relationship with the anemone where the clownfish receive protection from predators, and the anemone benefits from the clownfish' natural activity. For example, the wedging swimming movements from the clownfish stimulate water sirculation around its tentacles, increasing metabolism and growth.

Location		Dumaguete, The Philippines
Tags			anemonefish clownfish 2013 anemone
Latin			Amphiprion ocellaris
Description		Clownfish hatch near the surface and travel deeper to search for a host anemone when they reach their juvenile stage. Within a clownfish community there is a strict hierarchy where juveniles begin at the bottom and have to gradually move upwards by proving their abilities to the rest of the population. During this time they may be victims to agression, and possibly eviction from the anemone by more mature clownfish.

Tags			2013 worm
Description		Flatworms lack circulatory and respiratory organs (such as gills), and respiration is performed by diffusion through the worm's entire surface. They are somewhat similar to nudibranchs in appearance, but the similarity is only superficial. It's easy to distinguish them by the lack of antennas/rhinophores, that they generally move faster and are flat - obviously.

Many species of nudibranchs can retract these vital organs to protect them against other fish.

You may wonder why the whip is called black coral when it's bright green, and the reason is due to its black inner skeleton. The outer flesh varies in color and P. Unciger shrimps adept by changing their own skin to match the coral's color.

Most of the body is covered in sand, just enough is exposed to ambush surprised fish. This worm is quite rare, shy, and mysterious as well so little is known about its behaviour. It's theorized that the worm doesn’t see at all but use its excellent receptors to movements in the water to sense nearby fish.

The sandy bottom comes to life from all the crabs, shrimps, worms, slugs and bottom dwellers doing their brutal routine. Many of these animals feed at night, and the site turns to a large scale battlefield when the sun sets. A stargazer approached us in the midst of the chaos, landed on the sand and burrowed its tapered body, exposing only its big, heavy, flat head and a vertically slanted mouth. He waits for passing fish before jumping upwards while creating a vacuum to suck in the prey.

Description		The previous name for this anemone was the Ritteri Anemone, updated to Heteractis magnifica, or "Magnificent Sea Anemone". Perhaps so because it's too beautiful for the first dull name. The anemone can entirely retract it's tentacles. It's column, here in purple color, will then be exposed. On the matter of reproducing this anemone can do it both sexually and asexually - it can actually clone itself.

While this is by no means unique for an ocean species, it's still fascinating to observe this type of irregularity. Perhaps, a long time ago another species did just the same, and that is why there are creatures (such as you and me) walking on land today.

Most molluscs use the shell as a primary defence, but nudibranchs have developed other techniques for protection, such as toxic secretion.

Description		A hermit crab's home is the shell of a gastropod, usually snails. As they grow, larger shells are required. However, suitable intact shells are of limited resource and competition for the best shell among hermit crabs is common. If a crab looking for new vacancy finds a shell that is too large, it will stay in its current shell and wait by the vacant shell for other hermit crabs to arrive. As other crabs arrive and check the shell, they will do the same and when finally one finds the vacant shell suitable, each crab exchange shells in sequence.

It's herbivorous and feed uniquely on sea grass. Their numbers are very low and in some countries they are entirely depleted due to hunting, bycatch and habitat desctruction. I was extremely lucky to encounter one in Marsha Shouna on the western coast of the Red Sea, once home to thousands of dugongs but now with very few individuals.
